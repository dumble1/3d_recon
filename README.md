# 3d_recon

* Functions *

  - reconstruct 3d model from the series of 2d images.
    + mesh and Point cloud.
  - generate stitched image(orthomosaic).  
  - generate DEM(Digital elevation Model).(Probably from the 3d model mesh)
    + we can provide this with orthomosaic like how Pix4d does.
  - marker and annotation function.
  - measurment
    + measure certain length in the 3d model. (think about density of the 3d model, or rely on the 3d model viewer)
    + measure certain 2d area. (how to set the plane...? can we provide the curved plane?)
    + measure a volume of a area. (how to set the base plane? what if it is not just convex)
  - map
    + show orthomosaic and DEM on the actual map(ie. Google Maps)
    + CAD Overlay(not familiar).
  - File
    + mesh
    + point cloud
    + DEM
    + input images
    + orthomosaic  
  - Calender??
